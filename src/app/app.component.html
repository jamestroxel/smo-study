                        The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition
                        Service's (FNS) Child Nutrition Programs help ensure
                        that children in low-income families do not go hungry
                        and have access to safe, nutritious foods at schools and
                        in other settings. The National School Lunch Program
                        (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP) are the
                        largest Child Nutrition Programs. FNS oversees these
                        programs, and State agencies administer them through
                        agreements with local School Food Authorities that
                        implement the programs in schools.

                        FNS assesses school meal operations on a school-year
                        basis with a study series that was modified in School
                        Year (SY) 2020-2021 because of the start of the COVID-19
                        pandemic public health emergency—the largest nationwide
                        disruption of school meals programs since they were
                        enacted. When the pandemic began in March 2020, the
                        Families First Coronavirus Response Act provided FNS
                        with the authority to establish waivers for the purpose
                        of providing meals under the Child Nutrition Programs
                        with appropriate safety measures. With this authority,
                        FNS issued nationwide waivers of certain program rules
                        that provided States and local program operators with
                        flexibilities to help them serve meals to children who
                        were no longer routinely being educated in school
                        buildings due to the pandemic. The key Child Nutrition
                        Programs used to provide meals to children during the
                        early pandemic months included the NSLP, SBP, NSLP
                        Seamless Summer Option (SSO), Summer Food Service
                        Program (SFSP), and Child and Adult Care Food Program
                        (CACFP).

                        a school-year basis. When the COVID-19 pandemic public
                        health emergency began in March 2020, the scope of this
                        study was modified starting with school year (SY)

                    <p class="content-main-body">
                        The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and
                        Nutrition Service's (FNS) Child Nutrition Programs help
                        ensure that children in low-income families do not go
                        hungry and have access to safe, nutritious foods at
                        school and in other settings. These include the school
                        meals programs, which include the National School Lunch
                        Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP),
                        the summer meal programs, which are the NSLP Seamless
                        Summer Option (SSO) and the Summer Food Service Program
                        (SFSP), and the Child and Adult Care Food Program
                        (CACFP). Over the decade preceding the COVID-19
                        pandemic, the largest of these programs, the NSLP,
                        served approximately 5 billion meals to about 30 million
                        children annually.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-main-body">
                        FNS oversees these programs, and State agencies
                        administer them through agreements with local program
                        operators, such as School Food Authorities (SFAs). FNS
                        requires information about program operations to
                        effectively oversee the programs and inform current and
                        future policy decisions.

                        FNS has an ongoing study series to assess school meal
                        operations on a school-year basis. Topics studied by the
                        series include school and site participation, student
                        and child participation, and meal counting.

                        The scope of the study series was modified starting with
                        SY 2019-2020 due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic
                        public health emergency. When the pandemic began in
                        March 2020, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act
                        (FFCRA) provided FNS with the authority to establish
                        waivers for the purpose of providing meals under the
                        Child Nutrition Programs with appropriate safety
                        measures. With this authority, FNS issued nationwide
                        waivers of certain Child Nutrition Program rules that
                        provided States and local program operators with
                        flexibilities to help them serve meals to children who
                        were no longer routinely being educated in school
                        buildings due to the pandemic

                        The programs used to provide meals to children during
                        the early pandemic months included NSLP, SBP, SSO, SFSP,
                        and CACFP. SSO and SFSP are traditionally associated
                        with summer meal service, but these programs are also
                        used to provide meal service during unanticipated school
                        closures, such as those related to weather events and
                        other emergencies. SFAs implement NSLP and SBP in
                        schools, and they implement SSO at a variety of sites,
                        including schools, summer camps, and other locations.
                        Sponsors, which may include SFAs, implement SFSP at a
                        similar range of site types. Institutions implement
                        CACFP at child care outlets, including child care
                        centers and family day care homes.

                    <p class="content-main-body">
                        Data collection for this report focused on gathering
                        information about Child Nutrition Program operations
                        from March through September 2020, including meal
                        service and challenges, as well as statutorily required
                        information on the COVID-19 Child Nutrition nationwide
                        waivers approved for use during that period.
                        Specifically, the FFCRA required that State agencies
                        using each waiver report to FNS on (1) use of the waiver
                        by the State agency and local program operators, and (2)
                        whether and how the waiver resulted in improved services
                        to program participants. For certain waivers, FNS
                        identified specific actions that State agencies and
                        local program operators using the waivers were required
                        to take and report on. For example, for State agencies
                        using the waiver allowing parents and guardians to pick
                        up meals without children present, FNS required that
                        program operators put processes in place to ensure (1)
                        meals were distributed only to parents and guardians of
                        eligible children and (2) duplicate meals were not
                        distributed to any child.

                        (March through May 2020), the summer months (June and
                        July 2020), and the early months of SY 2020–2021 (August

                        meals served through NSLP and SBP decreased
                        significantly as school buildings closed, though some
                        children also began receiving meals through SSO and
                        SFSP. In addition, substantially more meals were served
                        through the summer meal programs in the summer of 2020
                        as compared to previous years. Child participation and
                        meals served through CACFP dropped at the beginning of
                        the pandemic, and then increased to some extent, nearing

                        When the COVID-19 pandemic began in mid-March 2020, many
                        schools and child care operators across the country
                        stopped providing in-person education and services,
                        resulting in a significant disruption to the Child
                        Nutrition Programs that typically provide meals to
                        children in those settings. During normal operations,
                        SSO and SFSP provide meal service during the summer
                        months and during unanticipated school building
                        closures. As school buildings closed due to the
                        pandemic, to ensure children's continued access to meals
                        many SFAs and local program operators shifted to
                        providing meal service through these programs (Food and
                        Nutrition Service 2020a) during the March through May
                        2020 time period.

                        SY 2019–2020 began as a typical school year, with about
                        97,000 schools participating in NSLP and 91,000
                        participating in SBP (Food and Nutrition Service 2020b).
                        However, after the COVID-19 pandemic began in March
                        2020, the number of schools serving meals through NSLP
                        and SBP dropped significantly. Some schools shifted to
                        serving meals through SSO or SFSP, and in April and May
                        2020, among the 44 States that provided school-level
                        FNS-10 data and 45 States that provided site-level
                        FNS-418 data for this study, about 17,000 sites
                        nationwide were operating SSO and 26,000 were operating
                        SFSP. However, the total number of schools and sites in
                        operation in April and May was still far lower than the
                        total number operating before the pandmic (Appendix

                        Beginning in March, some local program operators used
                        the area eligibility nationwide waiver to provide meals
                        and snacks to all children at SSO and SFSP sites. This
                        waiver allowed sponsors, regardless of their location,
                        to operate open SSO and SFSP sites. Among States that
                        provided data on use of the area eligibility waiver as

                        percent of SFSP sites in operation were new area
                        eligible sites. Overall, over 90 percent of SSO and SFSP
                        sites were open sites (Appendix Table

                        Before the pandemic, about 90,000 family day care homes

                        CACFP (Food and Nutrition Service 2020b). Although many
                        child care outlets stopped serving CACFP meals during
                        those months, the decrease in participation was less
                        severe in that program. For example, from March to April
                        2020, the number of outlets serving CACFP meals
                        decreased by almost 50 percent in the 43 States that

                        and IV). Families also adjusted to new daily routines.

                        About 3.5 million children participated in CACFP in
                        March 2020, when CACFP data collection for this study
                        began. In March, about 3 million children in child care
                        centers participated in CACFP and about 400,000 in
                        family day care homes. These numbers likely reflect a
                        decline in child participation that had already begun
                        due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Child participation in
                        both child care centers and family day care homes
                        further decreased in April to 1 million and 200,000,
                        respectively. In May, child participation increased to
                        1.7 million in child care centers and 300,000 in family
                        day care homes, as some child care outlets either

                        As the 2020-2021 school year began, there was a
                        substantial increase in the number of schools operating
                        NSLP and SBP, as some schools resumed in-person
                        operations. This increase in NSLP and SBP sites may have
                        also been related to uncertainty around whether
                        nationwide waivers would be authorized to allow
                        continued operation of summer meal programs. In June and
                        July 2020, the total number of schools operating NSLP or
                        SBP was about 2,600, and this increased to over 30,000
                        in the August and September time period (Appendix Table

                        meals through the other Child Nutrition Programs also
                        increased. The total number of sites operating SSO in
                        August and September was almost double the number that
                        operated the program in June and July. Similarly, the
                        total number of sites operating SFSP increased by about
                        40 percent as the school year began. The number of
                        outlets providing CACFP meals also increased by about 18
                        percent during this period. Despite these increases, the
                        number of sites operating in September 2020 was still

                        State agencies most frequently reported that decreased
                        Federal reimbursement resulting from decreased Child
                        Nutrition Program participation as well as various costs
                        related to serving meals during the pandemic contributed
                        to financial challenges from March through September
                        2020. For example, consistent with the operational
                        challenges local program operators experienced in trying
                        to ensure the safety of their staff, State agencies most
                        frequently reported that needing to purchase personal
                        protective equipment for staff contributed to local
                        program operators' financial challenges. State agencies
                        also reported that meal packaging costs and meal
                        transportation and delivery costs contributed to
                        challenges, likely due to local program operators
                        needing to find ways to serve meals to children outside
                        of school and child care center buildings. Local program
                        operators also experienced increased food costs, likely
                        in part due to supply chain issues (Appendix Table

                        Because many sites operating from March through
                        September 2020 provided SSO or SFSP meals, meals served
                        at these sites were provided to all children for free.
                        SSO and SFSP meals may be served at open or closed
                        sites. Open sites serve meals to all children from the
                        community on a first-come, first-served basis, while
                        closed sites serve meals to children enrolled in a
                        program at the site. The majority of SFSP and SSO sites
                        that operated between March and September 2020 operated
                        as open sites; closed sites made up only 20 percent of
                        sites operating during that time period (Appendix Table

                        The high proportion of open sites during this period was
                        likely related, in part, to local program operators' use

                        waiver, which provided flexibility for establishing open
                        sites (Appendix Table

                        operate in an area where at least half of the children
                        are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals, or

                        waiver provided flexibility with this requirement and
                        indicated that open sites should be targeted to children
                        who were previously eligible or newly eligible for Child
                        Nutrition Program benefits due to the economic impacts
                        of COVID-19. State agencies reported that the methods
                        used to identify new sites varied across SFAs that used
                        the waiver for SSO and sponsors that used it for SFSP.
                        For example, SFAs most frequently identified new SSO
                        area eligible sites as those that had been area eligible
                        in prior years, while sponsors most frequently targeted
                        near-eligible sites as new SFSP area eligible sites,
                        such as those in areas where 40 percent of children,
                        instead of the standard 50 percent, were eligible for
                        free or reduced-price meals (Appendix Table

                        remote learning in many areas in spring 2020, forced
                        local program operators to adjust how they provided

                        the COVID-19 Child Nutrition nationwide waivers, various
                        alternative methods were used to distribute meals to
                        children. The majority of State agencies reported that
                        more than half of their local program operators
                        implemented a curbside meal pick-up or drive through

                        was the most effective method for providing the greatest
                        number of meals to the greatest number of children. Over

                        sponsors operating SFSP, offered walk-up sites at
                        schools, child care centers, or other buildings, which
                        was one of the least costly meal service methods used
                        during this period. A smaller percentage of State
                        agencies reported that walk-up sites were offered by the
                        majority of CACFP institutions. State agencies also
                        reported that mobile sites at which a bus or van

                        operators were able to provide multiple meals at one
                        time to those picking up children's meals. About 30
                        percent of State agencies reported that more than half
                        of SFAs operating NSLP, SBP, or SSO, and sponsors
                        operating SFSP, provided two to three days' worth of
                        meals at one time. About one fourth of State agencies
                        also reported that more than half of these local program
                        operators provided a full week of meals at one-time.
                        State agencies reported both of these approaches as
                        among the most effective methods for serving the
                        greatest number of meals to the greatest number of
                        children. However, few State agencies reported that the
                        majority of institutions operating CACFP provided
                        multiple meals at one time. In addition, State agencies
                        reported that local program operators less frequently
                        provided weekend meals, bulk food packages

                        to their State agency in order to receive meal

                        frequently used paper rosters to count meals served.

                        waiver allowed parents to pick up meals without their
                        children present in order to minimize potential exposure
                        to COVID-19. Local program operators that used this
                        waiver were required to ensure that duplicate meals were
                        not provided to any child and that meals were
                        distributed only to parents and guardians of eligible
                        children. To ensure duplicate meals were not
                        distributed, the majority of local program operators
                        notified parents and guardians picking up meals that
                        children were not eligible to receive duplicate meals
                        and requested parents and guardians provide their
                        children's names or other identifying information when
                        picking up meals. There was some variation in how local
                        program operators for different Child Nutrition Programs
                        ensured meals were only distributed to eligible
                        children. For instance, SFAs providing meals through
                        NSLP, SBP, or SSO most frequently requested that parents
                        or guardians provide the number of children for whom
                        they were picking up meals. SFSP sponsors and CACFP
                        institutions used this approach with slightly less
                        frequency; they also posted signage to indicate to
                        parents and guardians who was eligible to pick up and
                        receive meals. Some SFSP sponsors and CACFP institutions
                        also requested children's information, like names, ages,
                        dates of birth, or grade levels, from parents and
                        guardians when they picked up their children's meals

                        Under Federal rules, local program operators must serve
                        meals that meet certain requirements, such as those
                        related to meal components. For example, lunches served
                        through SSO have to include servings of milk, grains,
                        vegetables, fruit, and meat or meat alternates that meet

                        operating each program in over two-thirds of States from
                        March through September 2020, allowed local program
                        operators to modify meal components served when needed.
                        This waiver was most used among SFAs, with nearly half
                        of those providing meal service during this time using
                        it for SSO. In contrast, few sponsors used the waiver
                        for SFSP, which is not surprising; while the SFSP meal
                        pattern is similar to the SSO pattern, it includes fewer
                        requirements that must be met for meals to be

                        reported that local program operators waived milk
                        requirements, with half of State agencies reporting that
                        sponsors using the waiver waived milk requirements for

                        followed by grains and vegetables; about one-third of
                        State agencies reported that local program operators
                        using the waiver waived the grains and vegetables
                        requirements for SFSP and SSO meals. Fewer local program
                        operators waived requirements for fruits and meat or
                        meat alternatives. For NSLP and SSO meals, local program
                        operators are also required to serve certain amounts of
                        specific vegetable subgroups—dark green, red/orange,
                        starchy, legumes, and other vegetables—to meet the
                        weekly meal pattern requirements. State agencies most

                        the Meal Pattern Flexibility waiver waived requirements
                        for legumes, and dark green and starchy vegetables;
                        however, less than 20 percent of State agencies reported
                        that local program operators waived requirements for any
                        specific vegetable subgroup. Across all Child Nutrition
                        Programs, most State agencies reported that less than

                        The COVID-19 pandemic public health emergency has
                        continued to affect Child Nutrition Program operations,
                        and as a result, how the programs have adjusted during
                        the pandemic will continue to be a central focus. The
                        next report in this study series is expected to be
                        released in September 2023 and will present information
                        on data collection conducted between December 2021 and
                        May 2022. This data collection focused on gathering
                        information about Child Nutrition Program operations
                        during SY 2020-2021 and summer 2021. The study also
                        continued to collect statutorily required information on
                        the COVID-19 Child Nutrition nationwide waivers approved
                        for use during that period. While some waivers were
                        authorized for use for the first time during that
                        period, many of the waivers authorized for use during
                        the March through September 2020 period were extended
                        into SY 2020-2021 and summer 2021. As a result, the
                        second year of this study collected statutorily required
                        data on both the newly authorized waivers and waiver
                        extensions, as well as the additional requirements in
                        place for certain waivers.

                        Operational Costs Reimbursement Programs. These Programs
                        provided payments to local program operators whose
                        revenues declined or were temporarily interrupted during
                        the early months of the pandemic due to COVID-19. The
